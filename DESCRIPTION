Description: This package provides different specifications of a Quadrilateral
    Dissimilarity Model which can be used to fit same-different judgments
    in order to get a predicted matrix that satisfies regular minimality
    [Colonius & Dzhafarov, 2006, Measurement and representations of
    sensations, Erlbaum]. From such a matrix, Fechnerian distances can be
    computed.
